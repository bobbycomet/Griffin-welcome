## Features

- **Welcome Screen**: introduction to Griffin OS and its unique features.  
- **First Boot Autostart**: runs once after installation, then removes itself automatically.  
- **Application Installer**: lets you install recommended apps (Bottles, OBS Studio, etc.) with one click.    
- **No Terminal Needed**: everything is GUI-driven â€” though power users still have full control. The terminal is only needed when you want to install drivers or address rare issues.
